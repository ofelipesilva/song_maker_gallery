# Firefox Temp Data

All files under this directory are in the gitignore. The screenshot bot service
mounts to this directory, and dumps log files into it. This directory can be
an entrypoint for collecting geckodriver logs and other firefox runtime data
if there is a need to improve logging in the future.
